![Profile image](files/profile_image.jpg)

I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Philosophy Department](http://www.creighton.edu/ccas/philosophy/) at [Creighton University](https://www.creighton.edu). I received my PhD from the [University of Arizona](https://philosophy.arizona.edu).

My research concerns issues in the philosophy of mind and metaphysics, with a particular focus on causation: what it is, what its properties are, but most importantly what its metaphysics can (and cannot) reveal about us and our world. I'm also interested in questions in the philosophy of science, language, and ethics.
