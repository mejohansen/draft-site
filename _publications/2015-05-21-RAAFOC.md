excerpt: 'Regularity theories of causation are guided by the idea that causes are collectively sufficient for their effects. Following Mackie, that idea is typically refined to distinguish collections that include redundant members from those that do not. Causes must be collectively sufficient for their effects without redundancy. While Mackie was surely right that the regularity theory must distinguish collections that are in some sense minimally sufficient for an effect from those that include unnecessary hangers-on, I believe that redundancy is the wrong mark of that distinction. I propose a way to develop the regularity theory without it. Rather than distinguish minimal from mere sufficiency in terms of redundancy, we should look instead to the influence that events have in the world. Causes, so construed, must have just enough collective influence to assure that an effect occurs. I argue that such an account provides a uniform solution to the problem of epiphenomena and a pair of related problems that arise for prior iterations of the regularity theory.'

Regularity theories of causation are guided by the idea that causes are collectively sufficient for their effects. Following Mackie, that idea is typically refined to distinguish collections that include redundant members from those that do not. Causes must be collectively sufficient for their effects without redundancy. While Mackie was surely right that the regularity theory must distinguish collections that are in some sense minimally sufficient for an effect from those that include unnecessary hangers-on, I believe that redundancy is the wrong mark of that distinction. I propose a way to develop the regularity theory without it. Rather than distinguish minimal from mere sufficiency in terms of redundancy, we should look instead to the influence that events have in the world. Causes, so construed, must have just enough collective influence to assure that an effect occurs. I argue that such an account provides a uniform solution to the problem of epiphenomena and a pair of related problems that arise for prior iterations of the regularity theory.
