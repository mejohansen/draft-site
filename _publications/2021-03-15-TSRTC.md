title: "Taking stock of regularity theories of causation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-03-15-TSRTC
excerpt: 'Regularity theories occupy a relatively small place in the contemporary literature on causation. Though they are inarguably of historical importance, they are often framed as facing, in the words of David Lewis, dark prospects. Given the litany of challenges facing every extant theory of causation, a cursory survey of the causation literature would suggest that regularity theories must be in some way especially flawed. This paper takes stock of the regularity theory of causation. It will introduce the theory and then consider three challenges to it: the problem of joint effects, the problems of redundant causation, and omission-involving causation.  The first is often cited as a special, and especially challenging, problem for regularity theories. But the force of this problem has been greatly overstated. The threat to regularity theories instead comes from the latter two.'

Regularity theories occupy a relatively small place in the contemporary literature on causation. Though they are inarguably of historical importance, they are often framed as facing, in the words of David Lewis, dark prospects. Given the litany of challenges facing every extant theory of causation, a cursory survey of the causation literature would suggest that regularity theories must be in some way especially flawed. This paper takes stock of the regularity theory of causation. It will introduce the theory and then consider three challenges to it: the problem of joint effects, the problems of redundant causation, and omission-involving causation.  The first is often cited as a special, and especially challenging, problem for regularity theories. But the force of this problem has been greatly overstated. The threat to regularity theories instead comes from the latter two.
