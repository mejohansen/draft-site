Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy concerned with what the world is like, as opposed to, say, what the world ought to be like or how we know what the world is like. In this respect metaphysics is not unlike the natural sciences. But metaphysics is not physics (or chemistry, or biology, or...). The issues that it concerns are more general and abstract. For example, physics tells us that it is a natural law that an object in motion stays in motion unless acted on by an outside force. In contrast, metaphysics aims to tell us — among other things — what it is to be a natural law, what it to be an object, and what makes a moving object the same object despite the fact that it undergoes change. This course will focus on a number of central topics in metaphysics: ontology & objects, time & persistence, personal identity, and free will.
