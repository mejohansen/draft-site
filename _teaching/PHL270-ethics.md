This is a course in ethical theory, primarily normative ethical theory. A normative ethic aims to articulate the basic principles of right action. It’s an attempt to answer the question, “What makes morally right actions right and morally wrong actions wrong?” We’ll explore three kinds of answers to that question — utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics — and their implications for real-world ethical dilemmas.
