Philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of our minds and their relationship with the world around us. It asks questions such as: In virtue of what does something have a mind? Are the mind and the brain the same thing? Can consciousness be explained in physical terms? How does the mind represent the world? What are beliefs, desires, and emotions? What implications do empirical discoveries about the mind and brain have for these and other philosophical questions? This course will critically explore these and other questions and, if weâ€™re lucky, make some progress towards their answers.
